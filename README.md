# Overview
The current Foodrop mobile app is built with React Native and Expo. React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android. Expo is a free and open source toolchain built around React Native to help you build native iOS and Android apps using JavaScript and React. We have chosen this stack for a couple reasons:
- fast development cycle due to one framework, multiple platforms
- faster development cycle due to Expo features like hot-reloading within iOS and Android simulators/devices
- FAST
